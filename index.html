        <h2>Hello,</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am currently taking part in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperDev which teaches Python and its various frameworks. I have mainly been focused on building backend applications and have also dipped into the world of data science.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
        As you can tell from my age, I have a lot of experience. I’ve started a few companies - some more successful than others. I’ve also worked in both medium-size and start-up environments. I enjoy software engineering. My curiosity and passion for staying current and not missing out have led me to believe that the only way to do that is to be part of the fastest-growing industry.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          I’m looking for my next challenge where I want to be an integral part of a good team, contribute to its culture and create a fantastic product.
        </p>

          <h3>Software engineering</h3>
          <p>
            I’m a self-learner. I have coded with JavaScript and VueJS in the past, but only last year in September I had a good window of time to pursue coding with Python on a full-time basis. I completed a Python Udemy course end-to-end, including all small to medium projects. I gained experience developing console and web applications using Python, Flask, SQLLite, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap and more. You can find some of my work on GitHub.

          />

          <h3>Data Science</h3>
          <p>
            My data science journey started a few months later when I needed to automate the display of data similar to the user's previous preferences. I initially started using the apriori algorithm, then moved to the cosine similarity. This triggered my curiosity to study graph-based recommendation systems more in-depth to create a smarter recommendation solution. Some projects I have worked on include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic recommender systems using Collaborative Filtering </li>
            <li>Simple model with LightGCN (a type of graph convolutional neural network</li>
            
          </ul>
          
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <!-- <img
            class="code-img"
            src="images/graph1.png"
            alt="code-img"
          /> -->

          <h3>Work experience</h3>
          <p><em>Account Manager in Large Format Printing Company</em></p>
          <p> My job involved working with customers to create quotes for them. This required a deep understanding of the projects they were trying to bring to life, the technologies available to choose from, and the compromises willing to make to hit the set deadlines.</p>
          <p><em>Co-founder Printing House</em></p>
          <p>
            A few years after graduating from university a couple of friends and I started a publishing company for a Pop and Rock music magazine. This involved building successful partnerships with labels, artists, and event management companies. We grew the company to about 30 full-time employees and contractors including photographers and journalists. In about five years we sold the magazine trademark to a big publishing firm.

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I started building a full-stack platform for early-stage musician discovery (ie Spotify for debut albums). I faced the challenge of creating a good recommendation algorithm that addresses both the cold start problem and the over-recommendation problem. I've read how companies like Spotify and YouTube have approached these issues over the years. For my application, I initially started using the a priori algorithm, then switched to the cosine similarity. This sparked my curiosity to further explore graph-based recommender systems to create a more intelligent recommendation solution.
