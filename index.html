          <p>
            I am currently taking part in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at
            HyperDev which teaches Python and its various frameworks. I have
            mainly been focused on building backend applications and have also
            dipped into the world of data science.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can tell from my age, I have a lot of experience. I’ve
            started a few companies - some more successful than others. I’ve
            also worked in both medium-size and start-up environments. I enjoy
            software engineering. My curiosity and passion for staying current
            and not missing out have led me to believe that the only way to do
            that is to be part of the fastest-growing industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m looking for my next challenge where I want to be an integral
            part of a good team, contribute to its culture and create a
            fantastic product.

          <p>
            I’m a self-learner. I have coded with JavaScript and VueJS in the
            past, but only last year in September I had a good window of time to
            pursue coding with Python on a full-time basis. I completed a Python
            Udemy course end-to-end, including all small to medium projects. I
            gained experience developing console and web applications using
            Python, Flask, SQLLite, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, and more. You can
            find some of my work on
            <a href="https://github.com/spas-mirchev" target="_blank">GitHub</a
            >.

            My data science journey started a few months later when I needed to
            automate the display of data similar to the user's previous
            preferences. I initially started using the apriori algorithm, then
            moved to the cosine similarity. This triggered my curiosity to study
            graph-based recommendation systems more in-depth to create a smarter
            recommendation solution. Some projects I have worked on include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic recommender systems using Collaborative Filtering</li>
            <li>
              A simple model with LightGCN (a type of graph convolutional neural
              network
            </li>

              My job involved working with customers to create quotes for them.
              This required a deep understanding of the projects they were
              trying to bring to life, the technologies available to choose
              from, and the compromises willing to make to hit the set
              deadlines.

              A few years after graduating from university a couple of friends
              and I started a publishing company for a Pop and Rock music
              magazine. This involved building successful partnerships with
              labels, artists, and event management companies. We grew the
              company to about 30 full-time employees and contractors including
              photographers and journalists. In about five years we sold the
              magazine trademark to a big publishing firm.

              I started building a full-stack platform for early-stage musician
              discovery (ie Spotify for debut albums). I faced the challenge of
              creating a good recommendation algorithm that addresses both the
              cold start problem and the over-recommendation problem. I've read
              how companies like Spotify and YouTube have approached these
              issues over the years. For my application, I initially started
              using the a priori algorithm, then switched to the cosine
              similarity. This sparked my curiosity to further explore
              graph-based recommender systems to create a more intelligent
              recommendation solution.
