          I am currently taking part in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at
          HyperDev which teaches Python and its various frameworks.

          <h3>Python Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning Python a year ago. Over time I gained a lot of
            experience designing and developing console and web projects.

          <h3>Data Science</h3>
          <p>
            My data science journey started a few months later when I needed to automate the display of data similar to the user's previous preferences.  I initially started using the apriori algorithm, then moved to the cosine similarity. This triggered my curiosity to study graph-based recommendation systems more in-depth to create a smarter recommendation solution. Projects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic recommender systems using Collaborative Filtering </li>
            <li>Simple model with LightGCN (a type of graph convolutional neural network</li>
            
          </ul>
          
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <!-- <img
            class="code-img"
            src="images/graph1.png"
            alt="code-img"
          /> -->

          <h3>Work experience</h3>
          <p><em>Account Manager in Large Format Printing Company</em></p>
          <p> My job involved working with customers to create quotes for them. This required a deep understanding of the projects they were trying to bring to live, the technologies available to choose from and the compromises willing to make to hit the set deadlines</p>
          <p><em>Co-founder Printing House</em></p>
          <p>
            After I graduated from university, two of my friends and I started publishing three different  pop and rock music magazines. We grew the company to about 30 full-time employees and contractors including
            photographers and journalists. This involved building successful partnerships with the labels, artists and event
            management companies.

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I started building a full-stack platform for discovering early stage
            musicians (i.e. Spotify for debut albums). I faced the challenge of
            creating a good recommendation algorithm that tackles both the
            ‘cold-start’ problem, as well as the ‘over-recommendation’ problem.The platform will also provide a place for interviews and podcasts with musicians who are just starting out. This is very important in the beginning as they are completely unknown to the audience.
